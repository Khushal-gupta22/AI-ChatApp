# AI-ChatApp

This is an AI chat App, built using frontend technologies ( HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and bundled using vite . App inspired by none other than chatGPT by openAI. 

The server side is hosted on openrender.com : [server](https://aichatapp.onrender.com) 
and the user side is hosted on : [AskTheAI](https://chatwith-ai.vercel.app)

> due to OpenAI limiting the API usage and time duration, The user side i.e the interface may not be able to show a valid chat output, so a video and image preview (taken at the time the project was made ) is shown below
